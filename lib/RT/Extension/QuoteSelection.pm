=head1 NAME

RT-Extension-QuoteSelection - Quotes selected text, if any, when replying/commenting to tickets

=head1 RT VERSION

Works with RT 4.0, 4.2 and 4.4.

=head1 WHAT'S THIS DO?

Highlight a snippet of text on the ticket display page and click a Reply or
Comment link.  I<VoilÃ !>  Your highlighted text (and B<only> your highlighted
text) is quoted in the message box.

Both the per-transaction Reply/Comment links and the Reply/Comment links under
the Actions menu will use the selected text, if any.

=head1 CAVEATS

User signatures aren't inserted when highlighted text is quoted.

The per-transaction Reply/Comment links will consider your update a response to
the transaction even if you quote from an entirely different transaction.  This
doesn't matter to most people, and only affects email threading.
